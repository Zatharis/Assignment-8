        <p><strong>Personal description:</strong>A movie about a rat who becomes a chef. The movie trying to teach the lesson that anybody can cook and it isn't something just talented people can do. I believe there is also a lesson in there about ego between the way one of the main characters, Linguini, develops, and the character actually called Ego.</p>

        <!-- Synopsis from https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ratatouille -->
